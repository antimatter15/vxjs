#summary Encoding JSON objects to URLs

= Introduction =

In Javascript, it's easier to manipulate JSON objects than URLs, and often data is in an object, and you want to serialize it to send to the server. 



= Including the Framework =

Include the vX Ajax function by either referencing the JS file, or by including the tiny snippet of code inline. The code is at http://vxjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lib/urlencode.js

== Arguments ==

vU(JSON OBJECT);

  * Note that it is not recursive
  * Data is not escaped

== Examples ==

Basic stuff.
{{{
vU({you: "suck", howmuch: "alot"})
//you=suck&howmuch=alot
}}}

JSON Post Example Function
{{{
function json_post(url, post, cbk){
  vX(url, cbk?cbk:function(){}, vU(post));
}

json_post("ajax.php", {you: "suck", howmuch: "alot"})
}}}
