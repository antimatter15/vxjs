#summary Simple, High-Level Fade In/Out animations

= Introduction =

Fading is probably the most common and most useful effect. It makes sense most people don't like the complexity of the Core Animation function, and want a simpler function.

= Including the Framework =

Include the vX Ajax function by either referencing the JS file, or by including the tiny snippet of code inline. The code is at http://vxjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fade.js

== Arguments ==

vF(DIRECTION IN/OUT, HTML ELEMENT[, FRAMES, INTERVAL]);

  * Direction is lowercase, either "in" or "out"
  * Frames/interval are optional
  * Frames is number of frames in animation
  * Interval is the frame delay

== Examples ==

Fade Out Document Body
{{{
vF("out",document.body)
}}}
