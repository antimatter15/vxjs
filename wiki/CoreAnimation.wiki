#summary vX Core Animation Documentation

= Introduction =

vX has a flexible, extremely lightweight CSS Animation system. Though it's powerful, it's not the easiest to use, and probably shouldn't be used directly (You may use the high-level animations like FadeIn/FadeOut).


= Including the Framework =

Include the vX Ajax function by either referencing the JS file, or by including the tiny snippet of code inline. The code is at http://vxjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/anim.js

== Arguments ==

vA(HTML ELEMENT, CSS PROPERTY, START VALUE, END VALUE, VALUE PREFIX, VALUE SUFFIX, FRAMES, INTERVAL[, CALLBACK]);

  * Yes, this is complicated
  * CSS Property is a string, Start/End values are numbers, Frame/Interval are numbers, prefixes/suffixes are strings

== Examples ==

Fade in
{{{
vA(element,"opacity",0,1,"","",20,100) //browsers except IE
vA(element,"filter",0,100,"alpha(opacity=",")",20,100) //IE
}}}

Fade out
{{{
vA(element,"opacity",1,0,"","",20,100) //browsers except IE
vA(element,"filter",100,0,"alpha(opacity=",")",20,100) //IE
}}}
